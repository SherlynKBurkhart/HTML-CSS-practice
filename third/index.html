				<h1>Type something
				</h1>
				<p>I need two columns with a place holder that is grey.  The top black box needs to say "Apple" and "Google".  The spacing in the html p doesn't change what I see on the screen.  I will try padding. Padding brought it center.  Now I need to space the words and move them left.  I will try margin-left. That moved the whole header over and I just want the words moved over. Style your "header p" in your css. These words need to be contained. Increase the width. A margin is now needed. Why wont the paragraph move over?  Try inserting a class in "p". Didn't work.  Try margin, border, padding. Margin worked.

				<p>The footer is less height than the header. I suppose this is because it has words inside the box? Still need to space Google and Apple. How do I get the footer container the same size as the header container?
				</p>

				<p>How do I get the text of this paragraph to wrap and go into the next column? If I just keep typing does is wrap or does it disappear? This is a great kind of puzzle. And does the white text just keep expanding as I type more and more text? It DOES!!  So how do I contain it? I need two columns with a place holder that is grey.
