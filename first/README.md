IF YOU ARE VIEWING THIS ON GITHUB, CHANGE THE VIEW TO "RAW".  IT WILL BE MUCH EASIER TO READ AND FOLLOW.

1. Change view to raw. (if you are viewing on github)

This is an example of an instructional design that I created to assist an individual who asked me to teach them some basics of HTML and CSS.

This README.md file provides directions for a beginner learning how to work with HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

I work on a MacBook Pro and these directions are specific for Macs and some directions may be specific for my Mac due to individual settings on my computer.  Please email me at sherlynburkhart@gmail.com with any questions, comments, corrections, or clarifications.

This project creates boxes of different shapes and sizes with a place for text.


CREATE A "myProjects" FOLDER

6. Press "command S" to save.

FAQ's
HOW DOES THE index.html FILE KNOW TO USE THE styles.css FILE?
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
"href" means hyperlink reference. The reference is the "styles.css" file.

WHAT IS A GOOD LINK TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HTML?
http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp

HOW DOES THE HTML FILE AND CSS FILE TALK TO EACH OTHER? In the <body> of "index.html", each <div> (short for a division of space) has a "class" attribute. Each "class" attribute is equal to a camelCase name chosen by the programmer. That name is then used in the css file to give characteristics to the element.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN 0PENING AND CLOSING TAG?
An opening tag does not have a backslash "/". A closing tag has the "/", . ie. opening tag <body>, closing tag </body>.
